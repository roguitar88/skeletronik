                        <p>Skeletronik is a newly born MVC community. We believe that the best of life is in the simplest things. Thinking about that, we solved to create a project standard that comes in handy for developers of any level.</p>

                        <p>There's always something new in the IT world, isn't it? That's why we thought of creating a new channel for those people who are fond of technology and always want to get updated information and technical skills. And as for the newbies, it's never too late to start programming, haha.</p>

                        <p>We also have the great pleasure of teaching you about other tools, too. You know, composer is largely used by the world's community of developers. But we also have Docker and other stuff. So... Are you ready to go on this journey? I am.</p>
